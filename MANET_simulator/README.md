# MANET_simulator
This is a crude implementation of the DSR algorithm
Your task is to go through the code base of the simulator and implement the simplified version of the DSR routing algorithm. 
The routing function can be found in simulator/node.py. Feel free to add your improvements to the code/visualizer but make sure to 
comment your work appropriately.

TO RUN THE VISUALIZER YOU NEED opencv and numpy.

pip install opencv-python

pip install numpy

For any problems with the simulator contact,
